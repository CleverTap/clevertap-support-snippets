 * Data types:
 * The value of a property can be of type NSDate, a NSNumber, a NSString, or a BOOL.
 *
 * NSDate object:
 * When a property value is of type NSDate, the date and time are both recorded to the second.
 * This can be later used for targeting scenarios.
 * For e.g. if you are recording the time of the flight as an event property,
 * you can send a message to the user just before their flight takes off.
